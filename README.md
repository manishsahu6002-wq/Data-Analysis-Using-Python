# Data-Analysis-Using-Python
In this project, I performed an end-to-end exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a Netflix movie dataset using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

The goal was to clean, transform, and extract meaningful insights from raw movie data â€” such as genre trends, rating distributions, and popularity extremes.
